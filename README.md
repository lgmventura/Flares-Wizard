Save, load: you can easily save your creation and reuse it any time, or even
share it.
Non destructive workflow: once you create a lens flare, you will need the

will still work, it's great for sharing your blends or sending it to a
render farm ...

flares.
Camera border detection: if the lens flare is no longer visible by the
camera you can make it fadeout.
